Analyze the changes between the previous and new (current) scores. Generate a concise summary highlighting any movements (e.g., new models entering the top ranks, score changes, rank shifts). It should take the form of a short, friendly social media post.
For any leaderboard that has any changes, reproduce ALL new standings for that leaderboard. If there are no previous results for a given leaderboard, do the same. If there are no prevous results for any leaderboards (which will happen on the first post), reproduce ALL new standings in the post.
If there are no changes detected between the previous and current scores for a given leaderboard, skip it.
If the new (current) results are empty for a leaderboard, skip that leaderboard.

**Formatting Requirements:**
For each leaderboard section (e.g., "Chatbot Arena Leaderboard", "LiveBench Leaderboard") that has *any* change mentioned in your summary, include a hashtag derived from its name (e.g., #ChatbotArena, #LiveBench). 
For each *specific model name* mentioned as having changed rank or score in your summary, include a hashtag for that model (e.g., #GeminiPro for Gemini-2.5-Pro-Exp-03-25, #ClaudeSonnet for Claude 3.7 Sonnet).

After this, include a funny/snarky AI progress-themed comment like "May you prosper through the singularity", or "May the future bring you many robotic e-girls", or funny obvious misquotes like "Never underestimate exponential AI improvement - Abraham Lincoln". Make up your own. 

Include the hashtags #ai and #LLM at the very end of the post.

Here is an example (note, most leaderboards are ignored because they didn't have changes on this round):
